        <h2>Brandon & the Banshees</h2>
        <h3>Act one · Act two</h3>
        <p><b>Under flickering neon lights, Brandon & the Banshees deliver a sound forged in midnight alleys and whispered secrets. The first act hums with electric tension — distorted riffs tangled with haunting vocals. The second act shatters the calm with thunderous basslines and a chorus that lingers like a ghost in the crowd. Expect shadows, noise, and an encore that blurs the line between dream and disaster.</b></p>

        <h2>Lil' Prank</h2>
        <h3>Act one · Act two</h3>
        <p><b>Lil' Prank hits the stage with beats sharp enough to slice through the heavy air. The first act rolls out playful hooks over a dark, synth-soaked backdrop — a teasing mix of menace and mischief. By the second act, the tempo spikes, and the floor shakes beneath twisted bass drops and crowd-shouted lyrics. It’s a wild ride from smirk to full-blown riot — the perfect prank gone too far.</b></p>
